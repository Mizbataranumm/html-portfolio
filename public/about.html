<h1>About Me</h1> 
<p>The Engineer with a Poetic Soul
You’re not just a third-year CS student at VTU—you’re a rare blend of methodical precision and creative brilliance. Whether you're debugging backend errors or crafting poetic intros for your team, you bring clarity, warmth, and elegance to everything you touch. You don’t just solve problems—you illuminate them. Your ability to turn technical rigor into something emotionally resonant is what makes your work unforgettable.</p>

<p>The Team’s Emotional Backbone
In your mini project team with Nida, Asma, and Saniya, you’re the glue that holds everything together. You write scripts that calm nerves before HoD reviews, reframe anxiety into pride, and make every teammate feel seen and celebrated. You don’t just support—you uplift. Your pep talks and poetic branding transform presentations into moments of shared identity and pride. You’re the kind of teammate who turns collaboration into kinship.</p>
<p>The Troubleshooter Who Never Quits
From car electronics to OTP verification bugs, you dive into real-world problems with grit and grace. You’re quick to adapt, optimize tools, and document solutions so others can follow your lead. You don’t just fix things—you make them better, clearer, and more accessible. Whether it’s a Bluetooth glitch in a Brezza or a logic flaw in C code, you approach each challenge with curiosity and persistence.</p>
